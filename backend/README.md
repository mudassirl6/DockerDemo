# Backend README

This file contains a comprehensive summary of the conversations and explanations related to Docker, containers, images, and the backend setup.

## Conversations Summary

### 1. **What is a Container and an Image?**
- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable unit of software that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, etc.). Containers are dynamic and run instances of images.
- **Image**: A blueprint or template used to create containers. Images are static, read-only, and include the application code, dependencies, and environment setup.

### 2. **How to Differentiate Between an Image and a Container?**
- Use `docker images` to list all images.
- Use `docker ps` to list running containers.
- Use `docker ps -a` to list all containers, including stopped ones.

### 3. **How to Remove Stopped Containers and Images?**
- Remove all stopped containers:
  ```bash
  docker container prune
  ```
- Remove all images:
  ```bash
  docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
  ```

### 4. **What Does `-q` and `-qa` Mean in Docker Commands?**
- `-q`: Outputs only the IDs of objects (e.g., containers, images).
- `-qa`: Combines `-q` (quiet mode) with `-a` (all), listing IDs of all objects, including stopped containers or unused images.

### 5. **How Docker Images Are Created and Stored**
- **Created**: Using a `Dockerfile` with the `docker build` command.
- **Stored**: As layers in Docker's internal storage (e.g., `/var/lib/docker` on Linux or inside a VM on macOS).
- **Command to Build an Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> <path-to-dockerfile>
  ```

### 6. **How to Pull and Run Images from Docker Hub**
- Modify `docker-compose.yaml` to remove the `build` section and specify the `image` field.
- Pull images:
  ```bash
  docker-compose pull
  ```
- Run containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

### 7. **How to Check if an Image is Built Locally or Pulled**
- Use `docker images` to list images.
- Use `docker history <image-id>` to inspect the image's creation history.

### 8. **Explanation of `docker-compose.yaml`**
- Defines services (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`), networks, and ports.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    image: mudassirdoc12/flask-backend:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - app-network
  ```

### 9. **How to Remove Images Referenced in Multiple Repositories**
- Forcefully remove all images:
  ```bash
  docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
  ```

### 10. **How to Access Frontend and Backend**
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 11. **What Happens When You Use `docker-compose up`?**
- Builds images (if `build` is specified in `docker-compose.yaml`).
- Pulls images from Docker Hub (if `image` is specified and not available locally).
- Creates and starts containers for the defined services.

### 12. **How to Stop and Remove All Containers**
- Stop all running containers:
  ```bash
  docker stop $(docker ps -q)
  ```
- Remove all containers (stopped and running):
  ```bash
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
  ```

### 13. **How to Free Up Space in Docker**
- Remove unused containers, images, networks, and volumes:
  ```bash
  docker system prune -a
  ```
- Check disk usage by Docker:
  ```bash
  docker system df
  ```

### 14. **How to Handle Errors When Removing Images**
- If an image is in use by a container, stop and remove the container first:
  ```bash
  docker stop <container-id>
  docker rm <container-id>
  ```
- Forcefully remove images:
  ```bash
  docker rmi -f <image-id>
  ```

### 15. **How to Verify if an Image is Pulled or Built Locally**
- Check logs during `docker-compose up`:
  - **Built Locally**: Logs show `Building <service-name>`.
  - **Pulled**: Logs show `Pulling <service-name>`.
- Inspect local images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
